在开放的资源软件开发中, 任何人都可以进入这个项目的源码  And, it's expected that the development process be
transparent by allowing anyone to access all issues and project
documentation.  That transparency allows potential users or
contributors to educate themselves and evaluate the state of the
project.  Transparency should be the rule for almost every project
almost all the time.  Exceptions to the rule are rare but important,
especially in large, very active projects.
